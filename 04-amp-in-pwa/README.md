## AMP as a PWA's data source

Most web applications are built as a dynamic front-end that consumes an API (usually JSON). But if one extends the previous PWA-as-an-AMP-hub example, one could imagine a world where modular AMP pages are served directly in the context of a PWA as a single-page application.

While this ties your content to the AMP spec, it also means that existing AMP content can be used to leverage the client-side performance benefits of the asynchronous, SPA experience without the maintenance of multiple back-ends.
