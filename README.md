# AMP PWA by example

As AMP moves into the publishing industry, there's more of a push to create a PWA "hub" that serves AMP-cached "spokes" (e.g. articles).

This repo shows a step-by-step example of implementing one of these kinds of AMP pages, from a static example pulled from AMP Start, through a fully-featured offline experience with push notifications delivered through the Progressive Web App core.
